                This book is a really interesting addition after having read Tolstoy's diaries. Whereas his diaries are
                very much
                concerned with the content of the faith Tolstoy professed towards the end of his life, this book
                explains, in an
                autobiographical manner, how he found that faith.<br /><br />Although he grew up religious, he abandoned
                his
                Orthodox Christian faith as a teenager. As a successful and well-off writer in 19th century Russia, he
                finds himself
                surrounded by people that are also non-religious and that encourage him to live an immoral life. He
                feels that this
                is wrong, as he has a deep desire to do good, but he is being ridiculed when he tries to act upon it. A
                couple years
                later he has a deep existential crisis that leads him into a state of despair and to the verge of
                suicide. After
                searching for the answers to the question of the meaning of life in the sciences and in philosophy, he
                reckons that
                Solomon and Schopenhauer are right and that life is an absurdity and evil. The only logical consequence
                is that it
                should be destroyed by suicide, yet he is not able to do this. This creates even more despair for
                Tolstoy. After a
                few troubled years he finally realizes that the reason he saw life as meaningless is that <u>his</u>
                life actually
                was meaningless, and even the lives of most of the people around him. He understands how the way that he
                lived in a
                bubble prevented him to find the truth, which is actually to be found among the working people, that
                live, day in,
                day out, without despairing about the meaning of life:<br /><i>"I instinctively felt that if I wished to
                    live and
                    understand the meaning of life, I must seek this meaning not among those who have lost it and wish
                    to kill
                    themselves, but among those milliards of the past and the present who make life and who support the
                    burden of
                    their own lives and of ours also."</i><br /><br />What he finds there is, of course, religion - a
                faith in the
                existence of God which gives those people meaning in their life. Now here is the bit that I found maybe
                the most
                interesting in the book:<br /><br /><i>"Whatever the faith may be, and whatever answers it may give, and
                    to
                    whomsoever it gives them, every such answer gives to the finite existence of man an infinite
                    meaning, a meaning
                    not destroyed by sufferings, deprivations, or death. This means that only in faith can we find for
                    life a
                    meaning and a possibility … faith is a knowledge of the meaning of human life in consequence of
                    which man does
                    not destroy himself but lives. Faith is the strength of life. If a man lives he believes in
                    something. If he did
                    not believe that one must live for something, he would not live. If he does not see and recognize
                    the illusory
                    nature of the finite, he believes in the finite; if he understands the illusory nature of the
                    finite, he must
                    believe in the infinite. Without faith he cannot live."</i><br /><br />I can't help but see this
                concept of
                faith closely related to Paul Tillichs <i>ultimate concern</i> (According to Tillich, faith is a
                centered act of
                being ultimately concerned). He also says that the content of faith does not matter for the definition
                of faith,
                which fits the indefiniteness of <i>"one must live for something"</i> in Tolstoy quite well.
                <br /><br />And then
                this wonderful passage:<br /><i>"'What more do you seek?' exclaimed a voice within me. 'This is He. He
                    is that
                    without which one cannot live. To know God and to live is one and the same thing. God is life.'
                    'Live seeking
                    God, and then you will not live without God.' And more than ever before, all within me and around me
                    lit up, and
                    the light did not again abandon me."</i><br /><br />What happens next? After initially embracing the
                Christian
                Orthodox faith from his childhood again fully, he grows more and more doubtful about the religious
                institutions and
                the rites: <i>"And I ceased to doubt, and became fully convinced that not all was true in the religion I
                    had joined
                    … But where did the truth and where did the falsehood come from? Both the falsehood and the truth
                    were contained
                    in the so-called holy tradition and in the Scriptures. Both the falsehood and the truth had been
                    handed down by
                    what is called the Church."</i><br />And so begins his rebellion against the institutionalized
                religion which
                finally lead to his excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church (although this is not part of the
                book).<br />His disentangling of the truths and the falsehoods of the Christian faith are also not to be
                found in
                this book, but it gets quite obvious from his diaries and maybe also from other books of his that I
                haven't read
                yet.<br />
