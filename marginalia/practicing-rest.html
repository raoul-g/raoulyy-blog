            Rest in peace! I was very sad when I found out that Walter Brueggemann had
            died just about a month ago. He was an appreciated Biblical scholar and theologian focused on the Old
            Testament. He was especially well known for his understanding of prophetic work: <i>“It is the vocation of
                the prophet to keep alive the ministry of imagination, to keep on conjuring and proposing future
                alternatives to the single one the king wants to urge as the only thinkable one”</i>. According to this
            understanding, he himself can definitely be seen as a modern day prophet: he was very critical of American
            consumerism and nationalism.<br /><br />This book is definitely not missing a certain prophetic dimension in
            that sense. It is a study of the concept of Sabbath in the Jewish tradition, its underlying principles and
            what applying them in today's world could look like.<br />As most readers will know, at its most basic,
            Sabbath can be defined as a religious ritual in Judaism in which <i>"certain workaday activities and
                ordinary busyness are suspended and brought to a halt"</i> once a week for a whole day. While Orthodox
            Jews are still living out this ritual in a quite radical way, according to the "letter", so to speak,
            Brueggemann insists more on the "spirit" of this law.<br />Generally he understands it as a <i>"cultivation
                of inaction in body and spirit"</i>. Nowadays we are used to being on <i>"the initiating end of all
                things"</i> - we want to always be in control. In contrast to this, during Sabbath rest, one <i>"tries
                to stand in the cycle of natural time, without manipulation or interference"</i>. From my personal
            experience I can say that this is a refreshing and needed exercise which always leaves my mind
            refreshed.<br />Even more than just a personal exercise, Sabbath has a societal dimension for Brueggemann.
            In our current context of market society, it serves as an act of resistance: by keeping Sabbath one is
            visibly insisting that our lives are not defined by the production and consumption of commodities. In some
            countries, such as Germany for example, this might manifest as the fact that almost all shops are closed on
            Sundays and maybe even in the fact that parking is free almost everywhere on Sunday here.<br /><br />What
            Brueggemann points at is indeed a huge problem. In our consumerist society we define ourselves by what and
            how much we can buy. As others have pointed out, the fact that we constantly compare ourselves with each
            other (especially now in the age of social media), is something that keeps us busy (work more to be able to
            buy more) and keeps us from uniting against the exploitative powers that be (to use the expression as coined
            by Walter Wink). One needs only to look at the CEO-to-worker pay ration from the 1970s in comparison to
            today to understand that something deeply wrong has happened. While in 1970 the ratio was at about 11:1, by
            2023 the average CEO of a major U.S. company earns more than 260 times what the median worker in the same
            company earns. I could write much more about this and how the doctrine of individualism is used to mask such
            injustices, but let us for now return to Brueggemann and the concept of Sabbath.<br />Inequality is hardly a
            new phenomenon, and Sabbath, according to Brueggemann, has an equalizing power: <i>"Sabbath is the great day
                of equality when all are equally at rest. Not all are equal in production. Some perform much more
                effectively than others. Not all are equal in consumption. Some have greater access to consumer goods
                [...] Because this one day breaks the pattern of coercion, all are like you, equal—equal worth, equal
                value, equal access, equal rest."</i><br />This equality fosters what Brueggemann understands as the
            final purpose of Sabbath: the creation of the <i>"neighborly reality of the community beloved by God"</i>,
            which can be understood, among other things, as an environment of security, respect, dignity and
            love.<br /><br />I want to end the review with one final quote from the book which sums up the problem
            again, and thus indicates why the idea of Sabbath is still prophetically potent, even if each one of us
            might find his or her own way of practicing it: <i>"Indeed, our consumer society is grounded in the
                generation of artificial desires, readily transposed into urgent needs. The always-emerging new desires
                and new needs create a restless striving that sets neighbor against neighbor in order to get ahead, to
                have an advantage, and to accumulate at the expense of the other. The power of such a compulsion to
                'get,' of course, negates neighborly possibility."</i>
