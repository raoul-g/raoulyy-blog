        <br>
        <div class="review-body">
            The novel 'Barabbas' by the Swedish Nobel Prize winner
            Pär Lagerkvist was published in 1950. On the surface it can be summarized as the story of Barabbas - the man
            in whose stead Jesus was crucified according to the Gospels. The story begins with his unlikely release from
            prison after the crowd shouts that they would rather have Jesus crucified instead of the thief and murderer
            Barabbas. He is certainly quite astonished by this and follows Jesus on his way to Golgotha where he
            witnesses his death from a distance. His sentiment towards this supposed Messiah suffering a cruel death on
            the cross is one of repulsion and fascination alike, and will pursue him for the rest of his life.<br />Even
            though his friends rejoice in his new-found freedom, Barabbas seems to not be able to fully enjoy it. He
            can't really return to his former life and is almost bewitched by the meager man who died in his stead. He
            approaches his followers, the first Christians, and tries to find out more about the life and teachings of
            Jesus. Although there are other characters beside him, the story mostly focuses on Barabbas's strange
            attraction to the community of believers.<br />In the second part of the story, Barabbas becomes the source
            of hope for another Christian to whom he witnesses about the death of Jesus that he saw with his own eyes.
            He tries to believe too, but cannot and - in a moment of trial - truthfully denies being a Christian. He
            thus saves his life but will lose it later in a confused act of trying to make up for his unbelief. Even
            though in the end he is in prison with other Christians and afterwards condemned to death with them - he
            remains estranged from them and, in the end, alone.<br /><br />The life of Barabbas, as depicted in this
            novel, is often understood to be reflecting modern man in his condition of unbelief. In the novel, the
            Christians experience deep joy and tranquility in the midst of their suffering, while Barabbas remains
            troubled and restless even as a free man. The Christian community is depicted as one of unity and love. Even
            though Barabbas yearns for love and a feeling of belonging, he can't find it neither with the Christians,
            nor with his former group of friends. While Barabbas is haunted by his past, the Christians have found peace
            with their past and have certainty for a glorious future.<br />To read this as a simple polemic for
            Christianity would be shortsighted. Lagerkvist does not depict Barabbas as a man who simply chooses not to
            believe in Jesus - he depicts him as <u>unable</u> to believe. He wants to believe but cannot. The modern
            man is confronted by Nietzsche's famous <i>"God is dead"</i>. For some this might mean the disappearance
            into insignificance of the God of the gaps, which get fewer and smaller as scientific progress advances. For
            others this is a signifier of the utter impossibility of a God after Auschwitz and other horrors. This
            <i>"God is dead"</i> is experienced by more and more people, be it intellectually, be it emotionally or
            spiritually.<br />Another way of understanding the death of God is by looking at the cross, and seeing what
            Barabbas witnessed in the novel: Jesus's cry <i>"My God, my God. Why have you forsaken me?"</i>.
            Philosophers
            like Slavoj Žižek read this as a hint at the divided nature of the divine. In this world, just like
            Barabbas, we
            experience separation: separation from the people around us, but also a kind of separation or division
            inside the depth of our very being. What religion offers us is the promise of oneness: the overcoming of the
            separation in our lives. In the novel we see this as Barabbas observes the Christians with their supposed
            inner peace and loving community. The truth is, of course, that Christians experience just as much inner
            unrest and divisions amongst themselves as other people. The crucifixion hints at the fact that there is
            contradiction and antagonism even in the absolute, which means it is woven into the very fabric of
            reality.<br /><br />Ultimately, Barabbas remains just as religiously invested in the illusion of oneness as
            the Christian believers. Perhaps the 'death of God' is less about the absence of a deity, but the presence
            of a division - a fundamental 'not-at-oneness' of everything. In this understanding, salvation is not found
            in the illusion of wholeness in the absolute Other, instead it is found in the embrace of the fractured self
            and the fractured world - a realization that tragically eludes Barabbas to the very end.
